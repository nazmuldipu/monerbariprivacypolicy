        <h5>Special Note about Children’s Privacy </h5>
        <p>Monerbari does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If Monerbari learns
          that Monerbari has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, Monerbari will take
          reasonable measures to promptly delete such personal data from Monerbari’s records. </p>
        <p>Monerbari understands the need to provide extra privacy protections to users who are children. To that end, features
          and services such as social networking plug-ins, behaviorally targeted advertising, and collection of data for the
          purpose of building user profiles are not available to users under 13. Monerbari also does not allow our third party
          partners who engage in such practices to access personally identifiable data from users under 13. </p>
        <p>Monerbari and its partners do collect non-personally identifiable data from children. This includes, for example, collection
          of IP-based geolocation data to ensure that the product, service or features served comply with applicable laws of
          that nation.</p>
        <p>Monerbari and its partners also collect data to assess general information about the use of products, such as the number
          of visitors to our sites and services and which sections of a site or service are popular. Monerbari also uses this
          data to provide contextually-relevant advertising to users, to prevent users from seeing the same ad repeatedly,
          and to allow users to personalize their experience on the site or service (for example, to save a high score in a
          game). Monerbari and its partners may also use cookies, pixels, hardware-based identifiers, Operating System-based
          identifiers, and software-set identifiers, to manage and measure the performance of advertising.</p>
        <p>Please note that Monerbari’s partners may have their own policies related to tracking technologies for analytics and
          ad-serving purposes. While Monerbari requires that companies comply with Monerbari’s privacy policy before Monerbari
          allows those companies to access our sites and services, Monerbari does not actually control third-party data collection
          and use. Monerbari encourages parents to review the list of operators below and to become familiar with those parties
          policies and practices. </p>
